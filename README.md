# Lab 4 Program 3

## Introduction
o	The purpose of the lab was to create a program that mimicked a basic calculator. The user should input 2 integers and an operator and have a correct calculation that displays their outcome.
o	This Lab was conducted by Dr. Arup Kumar Ghosh

## Materials and Method
### Methodology 
    The Programming Language was C++ and the code editor being Visual Studio Code. The computers to code included my personal laptop and the school available desktop computers.
**Procedures**:
    I first created 4 variables, assigning 3 integer variables and 1 character variable to user inputs.
    The user prompted inputs would be 2 integers variables, input1 and input2, and a single basic math operator, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division symbols,   to do a basic calculation, assigned to the op character variable. 
    The calculation would be accomplished through switch and break functions. Each operator, +, -, /, and *, would be checked by the switch function and only run the proper code corresponding to the proper operator. The answer would be assigned to the last integer variable, result.
    After the calculation was completed, the user’s original 3 inputs would be displayed back, along with the result.

## Results and Discussion
o	# Significance: 
    The use of switch and break functions was essential in properly filtering the inputs to perform the correct mathematical operation.
o	# Results:
    I have created a program that can perform simple calculations within the command prompt by the user’s choice.

## Conclusions
o	The skills I learned in this Lab have taught me to understand how to properly filter through a user’s inputs, assign the inputs to correct data types as variables, and use them to create a correct result for the user.
